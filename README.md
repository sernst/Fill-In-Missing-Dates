# Fill-In-Missing-Dates

A Cauldron notebook showing how to find missing dates in a Pandas DataFrame and fill them in.

The notebook starts by creating a sample data set containing a list of dates and corresponding 
temperatures. Then a number of date/temperature combinations are removed from the data to create
missing entries that must be found and filled in.

Then the missing dates are found and new rows inserted into the DataFrame to remove the gaps.
